# Feature Specification: PDF Download Analytics Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-simple`
**Created**: 2025-01-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a simple dashboard with count download URL, objective is count URL by status CODE, and track more accessible URL, more errors, and ETC. Using prisma with sqlite for persist data. Create a model for interacts with database. In dashboard, create a simple page with ReactJS and Vite. For login, using simple API_TOKEN define in .env"
**Constitution**: See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for governance and principles

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Download Activity Overview (Priority: P1)

An administrator needs to monitor PDF download activity to understand usage patterns and identify issues. They access the dashboard to see a summary of all download attempts, organized by HTTP status code, to quickly identify successful downloads versus errors.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - visibility into download activity. Without this, the dashboard has no purpose. It provides immediate operational insight into the health of the PDF merge service.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making several PDF download requests through the existing API, then viewing the dashboard to verify counts are accurate and categorized correctly by status code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the PDF merge API has processed 100 successful downloads (200 status), 10 not found errors (404), and 5 server errors (500), **When** the administrator opens the dashboard, **Then** they see these counts displayed clearly, grouped by status code
2. **Given** no download activity has occurred, **When** the administrator opens the dashboard, **Then** they see zero counts with appropriate messaging indicating no data yet
3. **Given** download activity is ongoing, **When** the administrator refreshes the dashboard, **Then** they see updated counts reflecting new activity

### User Story 2 - Identify Most Accessed Resources (Priority: P2)

An administrator wants to understand which PDF merge operations are most popular to optimize server resources and understand user behavior. They view a ranked list of the most frequently accessed URLs.

**Why this priority**: Once basic monitoring exists, identifying trends helps with capacity planning and understanding user needs. This is valuable but not critical for initial operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making multiple downloads from various URLs with different frequencies, then verifying the dashboard displays them in descending order of access count.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** URL A has been accessed 50 times, URL B 30 times, and URL C 10 times, **When** the administrator views the "Most Accessed" section, **Then** they see URLs listed in order: A, B, C with their respective counts
2. **Given** two URLs have the same access count, **When** displayed in the list, **Then** they appear in consistent order (e.g., alphabetically or by first access time)
3. **Given** hundreds of unique URLs exist, **When** viewing the most accessed list, **Then** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many top URLs should be displayed? Default to top 10, 25, 50, or all?]

---

### User Story 3 - Track Error Patterns (Priority: P2)

An administrator needs to identify problematic PDF merge operations that consistently fail, so they can investigate root causes and improve service reliability. They view detailed error statistics including which specific URLs or operations generate the most errors.

**Why this priority**: Error tracking is critical for service reliability but can be built after basic monitoring. It helps prioritize fixes and improve user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally triggering various error conditions (invalid URLs, timeouts, malformed requests), then verifying the dashboard shows error counts and identifies problematic patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** URL X has failed 20 times with 404 errors and URL Y has failed 15 times with 500 errors, **When** the administrator views the error tracking section, **Then** they see both URLs listed with their error counts and status codes
2. **Given** a specific URL is failing repeatedly, **When** the administrator views its error history, **Then** they see a trend showing when errors started occurring
3. **Given** multiple error types exist (4xx vs 5xx), **When** viewing the error section, **Then** errors are categorized to distinguish client errors from server errors

---

### User Story 4 - Secure Dashboard Access (Priority: P1)

Only authorized administrators should access the analytics dashboard to protect operational data. The system requires authentication before displaying any analytics information.

**Why this priority**: Security is non-negotiable. Without authentication, sensitive operational data would be exposed to anyone, which is unacceptable for a production system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by attempting to access the dashboard without credentials (should be denied), with invalid credentials (should be denied), and with valid credentials (should be granted access).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user attempts to access the dashboard without providing authentication credentials, **When** they navigate to the dashboard URL, **Then** they are denied access and shown an authentication prompt
2. **Given** a user provides invalid authentication credentials, **When** they submit them, **Then** access is denied with a clear error message
3. **Given** a user provides valid authentication credentials, **When** they submit them, **Then** they gain access to the dashboard and can view all analytics
4. **Given** an authenticated user's session, **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should sessions expire after inactivity? If so, after how long? Default to 24 hours or session-based?]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the same URL is accessed with different query parameters - are they tracked separately or combined?
- How does the system handle extremely long URLs that might exceed display limits?
- What happens when the analytics database grows very large (thousands or millions of records) - should old data be archived or aggregated?
- How should the dashboard handle concurrent downloads happening in real-time - are counts updated immediately or periodically?
- What happens if a download request has no clear URL identifier (edge case in the PDF merge API)?
- How should the system categorize redirects (3xx status codes) versus successful downloads (2xx)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST record every PDF download attempt through the API including the requested URL, HTTP status code, and timestamp
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist download activity data reliably so analytics survive application restarts
- **FR-003**: Dashboard MUST display total download counts grouped by HTTP status code (2xx, 4xx, 5xx categories)
- **FR-004**: Dashboard MUST display a ranked list showing most frequently accessed URLs
- **FR-005**: Dashboard MUST display error statistics identifying URLs with the highest failure rates
- **FR-006**: Dashboard MUST require authentication before displaying any analytics data
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate authentication credentials against configured authorization mechanism
- **FR-008**: Dashboard MUST be accessible through both API and web interface (per project constitution's dual-interface principle)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle recording analytics without impacting PDF merge API performance (non-blocking operation)
- **FR-010**: Dashboard MUST display timestamps for download activity to enable time-based analysis
- **FR-011**: System MUST categorize HTTP status codes into meaningful groups (success, client error, server error, redirect)
- **FR-012**: Dashboard MUST update displayed statistics when new download activity occurs (either real-time or with clear refresh mechanism)

### Key Entities

- **Download Event**: Represents a single PDF download attempt. Includes the URL requested, HTTP status code returned, timestamp of the request, and any relevant metadata about the download operation.
- **URL Statistics**: Aggregated view of download activity for a specific URL. Includes total access count, success rate, error rate, and temporal patterns (most recent access, first access).
- **Analytics Session**: Represents an authenticated user's access to the dashboard. Includes authentication status and session validity.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Administrators can view download activity statistics within 5 seconds of accessing the dashboard
- **SC-002**: 100% of PDF download attempts are successfully recorded in analytics (no data loss)
- **SC-003**: Dashboard displays accurate counts with less than 5-second delay from actual download activity
- **SC-004**: Unauthorized users are blocked from accessing dashboard with 100% success rate (zero unauthorized access incidents)
- **SC-005**: Analytics recording adds less than 50ms latency to PDF download operations (measured at p95)
- **SC-006**: System handles tracking at least 1,000 concurrent downloads without performance degradation
- **SC-007**: Administrators can identify the top 10 most accessed URLs within 3 seconds of viewing the dashboard
- **SC-008**: Dashboard clearly distinguishes between successful downloads and errors with visual categorization
- **SC-009**: Error patterns are identifiable within 10 seconds of viewing error statistics
- **SC-010**: Dashboard remains functional and responsive with up to 100,000 recorded download events

### Assumptions

- Analytics data does not need real-time updates (periodic refresh acceptable)
- Dashboard is for administrative use only (not end-user facing)
- Authentication is sufficient with token-based mechanism (no complex user management needed)
- Historical analytics data should be retained indefinitely unless storage becomes an issue
- Download tracking should not block or delay actual PDF merge operations
- Dashboard access is low-volume (< 10 concurrent administrators)
- Status code categorization follows standard HTTP semantics (2xx success, 4xx client error, 5xx server error)
